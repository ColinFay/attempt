# Introduction to {attempt}

# {attempt} 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColinFay/attempt/master/README-fig/attempt_hex_200.png)

Tools for defensive programming, inspired by `{purrr}` mappers and based on `{rlang}`.

`{attempt}` is designed to handle the cases when something / someone attempts to do something it shouldn't. 

For example: 

+ an attempt to run a `log("a")` (error)
+ an attempt to connect to a web API without an internet connexion (error)
+ an attempt to `paste()` `"good morning"` and `iris` (message/warning)
+ ... 

`{attempt}` provides several condition handlers, from try catch to simple message printing. 

`{attempt}` only depends on `{rlang}`, and every function is design to be fast, making it easy to implement in other functions and packages.

# Install

From CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("attempt")
```

The dev version:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("attempt", repo = "https://colinfay.me/ran", type = "source")
```


## Using {attempt}

{attempt} provides four families of functions : 

+ try catch 
+ adverbs 
+ if 
+ conditions handlers

### try catch

Try catch functions are a family of functions which are used to deal with errors and warnings. 

+ `attempt` behaves like `base::try`, except that it allows custom message printing. 
+ `try_catch` is a wrapper around `tryCatch` that has a consistent grammar and allows the use of mappers. 
+ `try_catch_df` returns a tibble with the call, the error message if any, the warning message if any, and the value of the evaluated expression or "error". The values will always be contained in a list-column.
+ `map_try_catch` and `map_try_catch_df` allow to map on a list of arguments to be evaluated by the function in `fun`.

### adverbs 

Adverbs take a function and return a modified function.

+ `silently` transforms a function so that when you call this new function, it returns nothing unless there is an error or a warning.
+ `surely` transforms a function so that when you call this new function, it calls `attempt()`.
+ `with_message` and `with_warning` take a function, and add a warning or a message to it.

### if 

+ `if_none`, `if_any` and `if_all` test the elements of the list. 
+ `if_then` perfoms a "if this then that".
+ `if_else` is a wrapper around `base::ifelse()` that works with mappers. 

### conditions 

+ `stop_if`, `warn_if` and `message_if` are easy to use functions that send an error, a warning or a message if a condition is met.
+ they have a counterpart in `_if_not`, and `_if_all`, `_if_any` and `_if_none`.

## About mappers 

Mappers are functions built like one sided formulas. 

In other words, `~ .x + 2` is the equivalent of `function(x) return(x + 2)`. 

The first argument in a mapper need to be `.x`.

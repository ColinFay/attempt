Title: A Friendlier Condition Handler
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Colin", "Fay", email = "contact@colinfay.me", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A friendlier condition handler, inspired by 'purrr' mappers and based on 'rlang'.
    'attempt' extends and facilitates condition handling by providing a consistent grammar, and 
    provides a set of easy to use functions for usual tests and conditions. It only depends on 
    'rlang', and focuses on speed, so it can be easily integrated in other functions and used 
    in data analysis.

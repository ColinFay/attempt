#' attempt package
#'
#' A friendlier condition handler, inspired by \code{purrr} mappers and based on \code{rlang}.
#' 'attempt' extends and facilitates condition handling by providing a consistent grammar, and
#' provides a set of easy to use functions for common tests and conditions. 'attempt' only depends
#' on \code{rlang}, and focuses on speed, so it can be easily integrated in other functions and used
#' in data analysis.
